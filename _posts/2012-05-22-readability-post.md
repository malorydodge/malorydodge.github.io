To utilize my new Python skills, I have been learning how to build Flask web applications. I have been experimenting with development inside of Docker containers. This API is written in Flask and takes in a string and outputs whether the sentiment is positive, neutral or negative.
The code for this API can be found <a href="https://github.com/malorydodge/SentimentAnalysis">here</a>
