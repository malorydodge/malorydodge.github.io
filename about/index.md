<center>Software Developer, Artist, and Musician</center>

## Interests
* Software Developer - I can create web applications in C# ASP.NET as well as Ruby on Rails and Flask. I have also built software applications with Python and Java.
* Artist - In my free time, I love to make wire-wrapped and resin jewelry and other art with my boyfriend. 
    - Check out our <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/peacekeeperstudios/">Etsy shop</a> for our handmade jewelry.
* Musician - I was raised by two talented musicians, and now I play bass guitar in Dodge City Band with my family. My mother, Marcia Dodge, plays the keyboard. My father, Daniel Dodge, plays the lead guitar. My sister, Melody Dodge, plays rhythm guitar and her husband Michael Curry is our drummer.

* Outdoor Enthusiast - When I'm not writing code, making art or playing music, I love to be outside! I enjoy hiking, fishing, swimming, kayaking and skiing.
